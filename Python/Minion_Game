About Game
Rules
The game is a two player game. Players are given a string S.
Both the players have to make words using the letters of string S.
Player 1 has to make words starting with consonants.
Player 2 has to make words starting with vowels. 
Game ends when both players have made all possible substrings. 
Scoring
A player gets +1 Point for each occurence of the word in the string S.
Example:
If string S = BANANA
Word made by Player 2 = ANA
'ANA' is occuring twice in 'BANANA'. Hence, Player 2 will get 2 Points. 
For better understanding, see the image below: banana.png
